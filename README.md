## üé¨ Usage

## User Story

- AS A manager at an internet retail company
- I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
- SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API:

- WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
  THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

- WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
  THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
  THEN my server is started, and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
  THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
  THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Testing

```sh
It is still under testing.
```
